Count the barn!

## Company description
Connecting finance with small farmholders

## Project Description
It's important for lenders to know the asset situation of the farmers, but its very hard to go to individual farmers, especially in rural areas in developing countries where farms are very small and it's very hard for lenders to visit individual farm/farmers. We want to develop a scalable way to identify & count certain farming/agriculture assets using remotely sensed satellite imagery within a specific region of interest. 

We would provide a virtual machine to candidate, where he/she should install the code and show optimized code is able to identify & count the assets. Working code on server is the delivery. We would like to publish this open source code on production server, with UI layer on top of it, to showcase some of the early capabilities in detecting agriculture assets.

## Available data
Data primarily includes remote sensing satellite data. Petabytes of data. Raw imagery files.

## Prior work
Open source code is available with training data which can help detect various different type of geospatial features such as maybe a type of tree or water well or maybe hut. This project is more on the lines of using existing code and optimizing it to track other types of assets.
